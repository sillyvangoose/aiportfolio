    "I think it is very generous to say that most ML modelers don't realise the bias is happening or they do and don't know what to do about it. That is not backed up with any evidence, and no sources are cited. Additionally, ML modelers not noticing that there is a bias is a bias in itself, they are priveledged enough to not think about racism or sexism, as the majority of people involved in computer science are white and male, so they do not think about bias being there. Additionally, if most ML modelers don't know it's there, then why is the first part of the article a list of instances of bias that are backed up by evidence? I'm more inclined to agree with the instances backed up by evidence that there has been bias rather than speculation/opinions that bias does not happen."

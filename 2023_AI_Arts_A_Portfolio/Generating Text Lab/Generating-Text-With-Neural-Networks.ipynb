    "## Description\n",
    "This neural network, specifically a Recurrent Neural Network, was created by Andrej Karpathy. The data is a combination of excerpts from several Shakespeare plays, the example given being from Shakespeare's last political play, Coriolanus. This neural network uses this large supply of Shakespeare to generate text that imitates Shakespeare's works."

    "## Predicted Purpose\n",
    "I can find many uses for an AI such as this. Creating Shakespeare adjacent plays could be helpful for a theatre company, looking to put on a parody of a Shakespeare show. It could also be used in theatre education as an introduction to Shakespeare. Some find Shakespeare very hard to deconstruct, so having text in the style of Shakespeare to deconstruct first might be helpful to some student instead of looking at actual Shakespeare.\n",
    "It could also be used as introduction to AI for theatre students who know less about the field. Among the theatre community and other people involved in fine arts, AI is thought to be only used for STEM subjects, more specifically with computer science. It is something that is not accessible or for them, and an AI model like this could show them that AI is for everyone."

    "Hugging Chat is probably a more advanced AI and has a larger repository of data relating to Shakespeare. Our model only gives the model bits and pieces of different plays, while Hugging Chat most likely has access to the entirety of all Shakespeare plays. This is probably why, when I asked Hugging Chat to finish the phrase 'To be or not to be' in the style of Shakespeare (but not actually finishing the quote in actuality), it essentially reworded the 'To be or not to be' soliloqy. When I asked it to simply finish the phrase, without specifying that I didn't want it to be quoting Hamlet, it did actually finish the phrase from the script of Hamlet. This could be a wanted outcome for academic purposes. Say you're too lazy to look up the script of Hamlet, or you're worried you'll get too many different results and you don't have the time to scour the internet, you could turn to a text-generating AI to finish the monologue for you, like Hugging Chat succesfully did. Maybe this is what our AI aims to be with more training.\n",
    "As a side note, with our AI model, since the only text we're training it on is Shakespeare plays, we don't have to ask it to finish the phrase in the style of Shakespeare, and it finishes the phrase for more than three words. When I asked Hugging Chat to simply finish the phrase (without saying the style of Shakespeare), it returned \"To be or not to be, that is the question.\" - Hamlet Act 3 Scene 1, which is true, but doesn't do exactly what I want it to do."
